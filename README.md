# Option 2: Customer Segmentation 
## Project Description

In this project, you will use a clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation on a dataset. Customer segmentation is a common technique used in marketing to divide customers into groups based on similar characteristics, such as purchasing behavior or demographics. By segmenting customers, businesses can gain valuable insights to tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service.

### Dataset
You can pick any relevant dataset. Choose a dataset that contains relevant features such as customer demographics (age, gender, location), transaction history (purchase amounts, frequency), and any other information that you think might be useful for customer segmentation. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before applying the algorithm.

([Customer personality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis))
Make sure you perform cluster analysis and interpretation:

Evaluate the quality of the clusters formed using appropriate metrics like the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or silhouette score.
Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each customer cluster, identifying meaningful patterns and insights.
Visualize the clusters using scatterplots or other suitable visualization techniques to understand the separation.
Remember to document your process, explain your decisions, and present your results effectively. Good luck with your project!
